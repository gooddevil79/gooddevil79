### little story :

<p>
at the beginning in college, I got acquainted with C++ language and it was my first experience in Programming world that i get into, still, something was misssing and i was a rolling stone, but i found my interest in front-end and web design occupation 
   </br>
I studied HTML-CSS for one year and focused on it at first so reached at very good and advanced level, after that i decided to study about CSS frameworks and libraries, so I start to learn BOOTSTRAP v4, as many developers at this field, after CSS and it tools, I started to learn JavaScript programming language and after finishing VANILA JS, DOM and OOP functionality, i could say I'm at a Junior Level of front-end developer but as you know there is many stuff to learn in our lives ;)
I also learned GIT & GITHUB which is one of nessecary skills in this path and occupation, with a very good coure and I think now I'm good to work in programming teams.
   </br>
I, Mehran Behroziyan, am Front end developer with perseverance, effort, intrested to learn more stuff and new experiences and teamworks.
